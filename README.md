Chromochat is a cutting-edge chat application designed to bring people closer together through innovative features and a user-friendly interface.

## Requirements
This section is optional if there isn't any special dependencies. Else a bulletlist will suffice, e g:

- Node.js
- Mongodb
- Amazon S3 access

## Features
This can be a list of features or just a description of what this project does / what can be done with it. I prefer presenting information in a bullet or numbered list as it improves the ability to scan through and gather information quickly. Short, specific pieces of information are much easier to digest.

## Motivation

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.

## Installation
A quick guide on how to install your project. For example:

1. Download the repo to your webserver
2. Run npm install
3. Install database
4. Edit config.conf with your database settings
5. Visit your new site!

## Dependencies
Listing other peoples work that your project relies on is not only in good taste it helps show what your project is built on and adds insight to compatibility/integration with outside projects.
 
## API Reference
This section is optional, but if your project is a library or plugin there should be some examples here explaining how to implement it and how to use it. There should also be explanations for functions/options/parameters in this section.

### Hello World example
In the head section of your index.html page include this:

    <script>    
        console.log("Hello World");
    </script>

### More advanced example
This is a more advanced example on how to implement the libary. In the head section of your webpage include this:

    <script>
        var myLib = new SuperMyLib({
            output: "Hello World",
            selector: ".someClass"
        });
        
        myLib.init();
    </script>

Then add an element in your webpage that have the class "someClass".

    <div class="someClass"></div>
