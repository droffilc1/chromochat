## Features

This can be a list of features or just a description of what this project does / what can be done with it. I prefer presenting information in a bullet or numbered list as it improves the ability to scan through and gather information quickly. Short, specific pieces of information are much easier to digest.

## Motivation

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running you just need to follow the following steps in your terminal;

```
git clone "url"
```

where "url" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository.

For example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/droffilc1/chromochat.git
```

Here you're copying the contents of the spendless repository on GitHub to your computer.

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```bash
cd chromochat
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
